**How I Met My Wife Thanks to a 1950s Austrian Physicist's Fusion Dream**
---


Marking critical points in a timeline, points decisive to one's present, is fairly easy. The future can be very sensitive to the outcome of simple events. The implications of these outcomes rarely imply direct causality, mainly because things are complicated and multiple intertwined narratives make up the next time step. The title is then a bit of a stretch but also a bit of a truth.

Let me take you back to where it all began, sort of.


### Thermonuclear reactions under control conditions

In March 1951, Argentina's President Juan Domingo Perón made a sensational announcement: Argentina had achieved controlled thermonuclear reactions. This was huge. We're talking about harnessing the same power that fuels the sun, a potential game-changer for humanity (still is). Standing beside Perón was Dr. Ronald Richter, an Austrian-born scientist.

Richter, a couple of years prior to this announcement was roaming Paris doing unnoticable stuff. Richter came to Argentina recommended by [Kurt Tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Tank), an aeronautical Nazi engineer, who landed in 1946 to be in charge of Argentina's Aeronautic Institue. Richter arrived after some boring negotiation and had the chance to meet and interview with Perón. After 30 minutes he managed to sell smoke, and he did it fast. He had convinced Argentina's president that he could produce unlimited energy through nuclear fusion (the narrative is longer but for now stay with this one liner, he sold the idea).

The global scientific community was stunned, the U.S., the Soviet Union and the UK, were pouring resources into nuclear research, and here was Argentina claiming to have leapfrogged them all. Newspapers worldwide ran headlines either lauding the achievement or expressing deep skepticism. After all, achieving controlled fusion requires conditions comparable to the sun's interior, millions of degrees and immense pressure. Not exactly easy to replicate in a lab on a small island in Patagonia.


### Back to Richter

Richter was sent to where Kurt Tank was, The Aeronautic Institue in Córdoba. Tank worked there in a medium-sized German community with many of his fellow engineers. Ronald Richter did not fit in. He was a paranoid, antisocial, and overall bad colleague. After a laboratory fire, caused by a simple short circuit—Richter became even more paranoid, seeing spies and saboteurs everywhere. Instead of dismissing him, he made so much noise that the authorities decided to satisfy his demands for a top secret location to develop his experiments. Richter never shied away from showing interest in moving to the US. Argentina's government saw this as a strategic threat to the nation's plan. After all, they still had trust into Richter's abilities to succeed in his ambitious goals of developing the Argentinian Nuclear program.

After 1-2 months of search, they found the perfect place, [Isla Huemul](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_Huemul). A tiny island 1-km away from Bariloche's shore, a small town near the Andes. Lots of fresh water, isolated, small town, fantastic sights and nature.

### Let the construction begins

What does one need in order to build a nuclear test facility? and what does one need to start testing hypothesis of plasma confinement techniques? Answers are multiple, but there are two required conditions, money, and someone who provides it. Who provides, agrees.

Details of the development of Project Huemul facilities in the island up to the press conference are a bottomless rabbit hole. Let me just outline the headlines of some of the events that occurred in this 1.5 years period.

- **extravagant demands**: Richter demanded top-of-the-line equipment.Military aircrafts were used to smuggle in equipment as contraband, bypassing standard protocols.
- **resource drain**: His project consumed vast amounts of resources. For instance, at one point, Richter's demands led to a nationwide cement shortage.
- **reactor building**: one-meter-thick walls in a never ending building redesign process in a remote island, in a remote town. In May 1950, concrete was poured for the main reactor on Huemul Island, consisting of cement, gravel, and sand with a hollow cylindrical space inside.
- **he did not like it**: Richter did not like a couple of small cracks in the structure + the pressence of steel (he wanted fibercement). He demanded that this massive structure be demolished.
- **deabte and demolition**: Despite his authority, this was really controversial and demolision did not immediately happen. A few weeks later, in June 1950, debate was so intense that Richter fled to Buenos Aires to meet with Perón.
- **ruler of Huemul**: from this incident, he got "presidential range" on the island and demolision occurred. You read correctly, he got Perón's permission to rule the island with the same legal power as the president of Argentina (Perón wrote this in an informal letter directed to Richter, probably because he wanted to calm down the Austrian scientists + it was and continues to be unconstitutional to grant this amount of power as president)
- **underground**: next best engineering idea, build the reactor underground. Hard rock vs. dynamite == 15 meter deep, 15 meter wide hole in the ground. Now this was going to be an underground facility.
- **fill it up**: ups, Richter for some reason regrets his decision. He the massive hole to be filled back again with concrete. Now finding little resistence, given his power. I am not kidding, he poured concrete into a hole he created a couple of days prior.
- **and the shit goes on**...


(If you need more ridicolous stuff like the above, I would totally recommend binging the full story written by Mariscotti [here](https://www.amazon.de/Atomic-Secret-Huemul-Island-Argentina/dp/1545569940))


### A lil bit of air

Accounts from those involved some way or the other in the project paint a picture of disarray during these years. The spending, unused high tech gadgets, general lack of scientific rigor, forever changes on the design plans, etc... moral was at its lowest among the almost 400 people involved in this top secret project.

Richter was still secretive, paranoid. He feared sabotage and insisted on working in complete isolation, which only fueled suspicions about what was really happening on the island. But just when air appeared to be completely depleted, and the project's death was a matter of time, an experiment refreshed everyone's spirit, "thermonuclear reactions under control condition"

but we know that this...

### It was a fugazzi (fake)

As it reads, it never happened. Lets break down what happened. This guy had an enormous circuit that attempted to confine plasma. He had measuring devices to measure the temperature and the elements burnt in the reaction. Devices then, would indicate the success or not of the experiment. So in summary:

Measurement device:

- one of the measuring device needed to displace a plaque along two rails
- the rails were shaky
- they shook (scared to death scared to look this halfway crooks (8))
- the measurement was spurious and defective

Richter:

- knew this, and he did not care
- knew he and his "project" were in danger
- decided not to replicate the experiment
- purposefully misinterpreted the results
- managed to buy approximately one year of time
- tolerance started to decay rapidly once again

During this final year a small boost in morale occurred, but too much had happened, this was "the bounce of the death cat". The non confirmed truth was already trying to reveal itself, wheels were set on motion.

### Skepticism

After this turbulent period in 1952, regardless of "apparent success", mounting skepticism led the government to appoint a commission of experts to evaluate Richter's progress. Integrating that comission was Dr. José Antonio Balseiro, another important figure on this story.

The commission of 5 scientists visited the island and discovered that Richter hadn't achieved controlled thermonuclear fusion—or anything close to it. He was truly a pseudoscientific lunatic with a bunch of expensive equipment. He merely had a basic, albeit massive, electromagnetic wave generator circuit. His methods scientific basis, and there was no verifiable evidence of successful reactions. Some equipment wasn't even properly installed. You can see Richter leading the path to his own grave.

The narrative about those days visiting the island, could make up a movie structured around the idea of truth prevailment.

The aftermath of the visit was tremendous. Bulky reports were made in favor of the fraud hypothesis. The project was deemed a complete hoax, and Richter got kicked in the butt. The timeline is different and more interesting, but out of the scope of this little story. Once again, I suggest emphatically reading Mariscotti's book.

### Out of the Ashes, The Bariloche Atomic Center
---

Rather than abandoning nuclear research altogether, Argentina decided to make lemonade out of lemons. The facilities on Huemul Island were repurposed, and in 1955, the Bariloche Atomic Center was established. This time, the focus was on genuine scientific advancement, education, and collaboration. After all Richter made the Argentine government spend a lot of money on useful equipment.

José Antonio Balseiro played a pivotal role. He helped transforming the center into a legitimate institution for nuclear research and higher education. Tragically, Balseiro passed away at the young age of 43, but his legacy lived on. The institute was renamed [Instituto Balseiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balseiro_Institute) in his honor, and it became one of the most prestigious science and engineering schools in Latin America.


### Fast Forward to 2018

Now, let's jump ahead to 2018. That's the year I was accepted into the Instituto Balseiro, a place that might not have existed if it weren't for Richter's faky experiments.

Studying at Balseiro was a surreal experience. As for me, I can't help but feel grateful for that Austrian physicist who sold Argentina on a fusion fantasy. His failed project indirectly led to the creation of an institution that not only shaped my career but also brought me together with the friends whom now I call brothers.

But most importantly, the person I love most, my wife Majo.
