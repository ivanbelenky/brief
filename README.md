### be brief and carry my briefcase, light, but full with mental spasms
---

I had to start repeating like a mantra any word in the `brief` realm. I had a very tough 2019, mostly becase of love, and those heart young adult issues, fairly speaking, were my fault. What part of me was failing though? I imagined I was kind of reliable, not perfect, but not a single subsystem was deteriorated to the point of failure causing as much collateral damage to destroy it all. It was rather the spirit of my persona. Nothing has changed radically for me for the past 5 years, except for the constraints I impose to myself. If I were a linux command the verbose flag will be true. The level of verbosity has been reduced, and better directed. I am a better allocator.

being brief is the attempt here, and all my brief (or desired brief) thoughts will be present here --> funneled to this nice static jinja based templated h4ck3rm4n [page](https://ivanbelenky.com)
