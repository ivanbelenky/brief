### be brief
---

A couple of years ago, I had to start repeating to myself, in a mantra-ish way, `brief`, `be brief`, or any word/phrase close to its meaning.

I had a very tough 2019, failed love was the reason behind it, and those young adult heart issues were my fault. What part of me was failing though? I imagined I was kind of reliable, not perfect, but not a single subsystem was deteriorated to the point of failure. Nothing was causing so much collateral damage to destroy it all. It was rather the spirit of my persona.

Nothing has changed radically for me for the past 5 years, except for new constraints I impose to myself. If I were a linux command the verbose flag will be true. The level of verbosity has been reduced, and better directed. I am a better allocator in this regard.

Being brief is the attempt here, and all my brief (or desired to be brief) thoughts are present here and also --> funneled to this nice static jinja based templated h4ck3rm4n [page](https://ivanbelenky.com)
